# Nexter Project
### This project was a part of [Advanced CSS & SASS Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) which allowed me to use CSS GRID layouts to make a modern real-estate website.

#### In this project I used: 
* CSS-Grid Layouts and all of its properties
* Media queries to change the grid layouts for different screen sizes
* Used some grid methods to adopt layouts according to screen widths without using media queries
* centering pictures in a grid
* Used Flexbox along with grids
* CSS architecture: component-based design, BEM, writing reusable code, etc.
